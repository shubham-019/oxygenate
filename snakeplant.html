            <p>Snake plant, also known as "mother-in-law's tongue", is noted for its remarkable efficiency in producing oxygen. Even before its oxygen-producing properties, it was one of the most popular indoor plants, finding its way into both homes and offices.<br>
            This plant purifies the air by absorbing formaldehyde, nitrogen oxide, xylene, benzene, and trichloroethylene, according to NASA-sponsored clean air research. This plant is unique in that it photosynthesizes during the day and respirators at night, which means it absorbs oxygen at night and should not be kept in the bedroom.
