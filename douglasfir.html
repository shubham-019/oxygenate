            <p>Pine trees are known to purify the air around us. Even their scent is helpful in reducing inflammation for people with asthma or allergies.<br>
            Famous as the Christmas tree, Douglas fir pine trees are a great addition to any yard. They are medium-sized to large evergreen trees that grow up to 30-70 feet. Douglas fir pine trees have soft, flat needles that reach up to 4 centimeters long.<br>
            Pine trees prefer acidic or neutral soils and thrive in dry sites with little moisture. Caring for your soil is the best way to keep your trees and plants healthy.
