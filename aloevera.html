            <p>Aloevera's benefits are well-known. Its air-cleaning and oxygen-increasing capabilities, on the other hand, may be unfamiliar to many. The Aloe Vera Plant is well recognised for removing toxins such as aldehydes and benzene from the air.<br>
            Unlike most plants, it also produces oxygen at night, making it ideal for bedrooms and other enclosed spaces. They have broad pointed leaves with white clear gel and grow slowly. It is a medicinal plant that is utilised for a variety of treatments and natural therapies all over the world.
