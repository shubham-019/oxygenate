            <p>This plant, also known as Holy Basil or spiritual foliage, is native to India and Southeast Asia. It is also known as the "Queen of Herbs" and has a significant religious importance in Hinduism.<br>
            Tulsi is used for a variety of purposes, including treating asthma, colds, sore throats, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol, as well as stress relief and inflammation control. It is recognised for producing oxygen for 20 hours a day and absorbing hazardous poisons such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and sulphur dioxide.
