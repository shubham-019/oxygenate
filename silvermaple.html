            <p>Silver Maple trees grow very rapidly and tend to provide shade earlier than most trees. These trees prefer slightly acidic soil and can grow up to 50 feet. Their leaves, which have green tops and silver bottoms, coin their given name.<br>
            When planting a silver maple tree, itâ€™s important to water it daily until it has taken root. Once rooted, you can begin to water it weekly.
