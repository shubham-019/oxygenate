            <p>A bamboo plant is a great outdoor plant for homes that may not get a lot of sunlight. Although this plant will grow taller with more sunlight, it can still thrive in low-light conditions. Mature bamboo plants will grow from 4-12 feet tall with a span of 3-5 feet. Provide ample space in your flowerpot for their growth.<br>
            Bamboo palms also need high-quality potting soil to thrive. Similar to the areca plant, bamboo plants also need ideal drainage to thrive. Although these plants grow like trees, they tend to have sensitive roots. When watering, donâ€™t use cold water as it will shock the roots. Instead, offer your bamboo plants room temperature water.
