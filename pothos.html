            <p>Pothos is a lovely and active foliage plant that is also very easy to care for! It's a fantastic plant for improving indoor air quality. It is renowned for generating pollutants like as formaldehyde, benzene, and carbon monoxide into the atmosphere.<br>
            It is a wonderful indoor plant for oxygen production and release at night. Pothos is the best indoor plant for oxygen because of its high rate of conversion. It was able to show a 6.5 percent decreased carbon dioxide in an experiment, where the CO2 content was reduced from 454PPM to 425PPM, resulting in higher oxygen levels.
