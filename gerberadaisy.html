            <p>The Gerbera Daisy, arguably the most attractive of the bunch, is frequently used as a decorative element in gardens. The vibrant flowering plant not only adds color to the room, but it also serves as a wonderful source of oxygen.<br>
            Gerbera Daisy, according to NASA's Clean Air Study, eliminates contaminants from the air such as formaldehyde, benzene, and trichloroethylene. It's also recognized for releasing oxygen and collecting CO2 at night. Keep gerbera daisies on your bedside for improved sleep if you suffer from sleep apnea or breathing problems.
