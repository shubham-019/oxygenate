            <p>Red cedar trees, also known as the Eastern Juniper, are native to the United States. Their native region travels from Canada to Florida and out to Texas.<br>
            Red cedar trees can tolerate hot, dry weather, and grow in hardiness zones from 2-19. These trees can even grow in poor soil conditions which means they are suited for any type of landscape.
